# React-Challenges
React exercises to warm up before a React Coding Interview.

### Template solutions
For most exercises, there's is a template solution you can enable in case you want to look at the final result to clarify what needs to be done in each exercise or in case you are a bit lost and want to take a look at the sample solution.

To enable a template solution, you just have to comment the following block of code:

```jsx
const App = () => {
   return <i>Content here</i>;
};
```

And just add the import from the template solution at the top:

```javascript
import App from "./TodoList-template";
```
