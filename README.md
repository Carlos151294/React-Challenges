# React-Challenges
React exercises to warm up before a React Coding Interview

For most exercises, there's is a template solution you can enable in case you want to look at the final result to clarify what needs to be done in each exercise. 

To enable a template solution, you just have to comment the following block of code:

```
const App = () => {
//   return <i>Content here</i>;
// };
```
